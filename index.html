	<p class="lead">Hi, welcome to my portfolio!</p>
	<p>I am a data professional with prior experience in engineering including analytics, project management and team leadership. Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley (MIDS), and I am also a Teaching Assitant for the Statistics for Data Science Course [(W203)](https://mids-w203.github.io/syllabus/).</p>
	<p>Most of the projects that I built were originated from the courses that I took in MIDS. My goals when building these projects are deriving insights from the data and level up essential skills in programing, statistics and machine learning to be successful in Tech.</p>
 	<p>I hope you find them interesting, and I am very welcome for any recommendations or if you have some awesome ideas and would like to partner up please give me shout.</p>
