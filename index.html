	<p class="lead">Hi, welcome to my portfolio!</p>
	<p>I am a data professional with prior experience in engineering including analytics, project management and team leadership. Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley <a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/curriculum/">(MIDS)</a>, and I am also a Teaching Assitant for the Statistics for Data Science Course <a href="https://mids-w203.github.io/syllabus/">(W203)</a>.</p>
	<p>Most of my following projects were originated from the courses that I took in <a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/curriculum/">MIDS</a>. My goals when building these projects are deriving insights from the data and level up essential skills in programing, statistics and machine learning to be successful in Tech.</p>
 	<p>I hope you find them interesting, and I am very welcome for any recommendations. If you have an awesome idea and would like to team up please don't mind giving me a shout.</p>
